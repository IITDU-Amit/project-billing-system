Identifying Analysis Class
To identify our analysis class, we firstly grammatically parsed all the nouns and then categorized them according to general classification and selection criteria.
Following are the steps we used to analysis the classes for our system.

External Entities: User
Things: Password, User Name, Email, Bill Name, Category, Bill Amount, User Type, Bill 
Occurrence or events: ---	
Roles: Admin, Director, Coordinator
Organizational units: ---
Places: ---
Structure: ---

Step-1: Grammatical parsing (noun identifying) and categorizing using general classification:
After categorizing noun using general classification, we follow the next step to identify preliminary classes. In this step, we find the noun which 
fulfill at least three selection criteria or is an essential requirement.

Step-2:  Selection Criteria:
1. Retained information
2. Needed services
3. Multiple attributes
4. Common attributes
5. Common operations
6. Essential requirements


Potential Class	Characteristic Number That Applies	Remarks
User		2,3,6				Accepted
Admin		2,3,6				Accepted
Director		2,3,6				Accepted
Coordinator	2,3,6				Accepted
Category		1,3				Accepted
Password		1				Rejected
User Name	1				Rejected
Bill Name		1				Rejected
Bill Amount	1				Rejected
Email		1,2				Rejected
User Type		1				Rejected
Bill		1,3,6				Accepted

Nouns that hold essential requirement we took them essential for our system and include them in our analysis classes.
Preliminary Classes: 
1.	User
2.	Director
3.	Coordinator
4.	Admin
5.	Bill

Attributes Selection:
So, the retrieved attributes are listed below with the preliminary classes.
 
Class Name	Attributes

Director		User Name

		User Id
		User Type

Admin		User Name
		Password
		User Id
		User Type

Coordinator	User Name
		Password
		User Id

Step-3: Method Identification:

To identify methods, we will find out the verbs of the user story and will identify which one is in scope of the problem and which one is out of scope.

Verb Detection:
No	Verb		Remark
1.	Promote		Yes
2.	Demote		Yes
3.	Sign Up		Yes
4.	Sign In		Yes
5.	Sign Out		Yes
6.	Provide		Out of Scope
7.	Select		Out of Scope
8.	Approve		Yes
9.	Enter		Out of Scope
10.	 Pdf Generate	Yes
11.	Notify		Yes
12.	Bill Create		Yes
13.	Reject		Yes
14.	Add 		Yes
15.	Reject		Yes
16.	Send		Out of Scope
17.	Check		Out of Scope
18.	Edit		Yes


So, the methods of the classes are listed below.

After analyzing each classes we found that Admin, Coordinator, Director have similar attributes and methods. So we can consider a super class named “Admin Panel” of them which will hold common attributes and common methods. Other classes will be sub class of this super class.

Common Attributes: User ID, User Name, Password, Email, User Type 
Common Methods: SignOut(), SignIn(), SignUp(), Approve(), Reject()
