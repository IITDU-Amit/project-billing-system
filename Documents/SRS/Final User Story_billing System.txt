Billing System
User Scenario
The billing system has four types of users: an admin, a director, coordinators and normal users. 
The admin has the supreme authority over the whole system. He can promote any user to a coordinator.
Also anytime he can demote a coordinator to a normal user.
Every user needs to be authenticated to enter into the system.Each user must provide following information during 
registration.
	1. User's full Name
	2. User's Email Address
	3. User's designation
	5. Password
There are some categories on which  bills are made. If a user wants to make a bill, he enters the name of the 
bill. Then he selects the category/categories of the corresponding bill and enters the amount for each category. 
If the category is not listed, the user can request for adding new category. The admin adds new categories based 
on requests from the users.
Then the user creates a document of the bill and sends this document to the corresponding coordinator
of the bill. The coordinator makes a validation check on the bill and then approves or rejects the 
bill. If the bill is approved or rejected, the user is notified about it. If a bill is rejected, 
the user can edit the billing document and send it back to the coordinator again for approval. If the 
bill is approved, the coordinator sends it to the director for final approval. When a bill is sent 
for final approval, the user is notified about it again. The director approves it and the system 
notifies the user about the approval. After final approval, user can generate a pdf of the bill 
and print it out.
